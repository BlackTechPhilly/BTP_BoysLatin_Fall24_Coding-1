# What is a function?

# A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task 
# or job. 

# There are 2 variations to python functions:
# Built-In Functions- These are instructions for code that
# has been pre-written in the programming language. All we need to
# do is pass our data into it. 

# example of built-in functions
#print('coding class')

#name = input('What is your name?')

#print('hello ' + name)

# User- Defined Functions- Are custom functions where engineers
# provide the instructions and the data. 

# syntax - how is it written
 
# function definition = telling the computer what you want it to do.
def sandwich():
    print('step 1. get bread')
    print('step 2. get ingredients')
    print('step 3. put it together.' )

# function call= runs your code when you tell it to. 
#sandwich()

def multiply(number):
    print(number * 825)
#multiply(5)
