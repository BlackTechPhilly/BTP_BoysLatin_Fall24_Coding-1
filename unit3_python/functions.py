# What is a function?

# A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task 
# or job. 

# There are 2 variations to python functions:
# Built-In Functions- These are instructions for code that
# has been pre-written in the programming language. All we need to
# do is pass our data into it. 

# example of built-in functions
print('coding class')

name = input('What is your name?')

print('hello ' + name)

# User- Defined Functions- Are custom functions where engineers
# provide the instructions and the data. 

# syntax - how is it written
 
# function definition = telling the computer what you want it to do.
