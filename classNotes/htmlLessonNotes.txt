HTML is the structure That provides the shape and base 
design of a website and its features.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Every website that is accessible on the internet 
is built upon HTML.

HTML is comprised of elements, which are 
blocks of code that use tags to display some sort of content.

(Example of an Element) <html_Tag> Content </html_Tag> 

HTML tags are built in pieces of code that do a specific 
task to create an html element. HTML tags come in pairs 
that feature an opening and closing tag. We 

(Opening Tag) <html_Tag> 
(Closing tag) </html_Tag>

We use boilerplate, which is re-usable, pre-written code. to construct
a basic HTML page. 

(Example of Boilerplate html code)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>ExamplePage Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
 
 When we write html code, all of our code must go between the body tags.
 This is the visible area of the HTML structure (the things that you
 see on the webpage.)
