## Restuarant Website Overview
In this week’s lesson, you will continue getting hands-on learning on HTML and CSS skills by working on a collaborative group project. Each group will design and develop the interface of a fictional restuarant of their own creation using HTML and CSS. Each group's restuarant shop must have a unique feature or selling point that makes it stand out amongst other restuarants (for example a donut shop luandry mat). The project must meet the criteria outlined below to receive full credit.

### Criteria
