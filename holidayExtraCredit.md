## Holiday schedule function

Create a function that will act as your holiday schedule planner. When you pass in a date. The event
calenar should return an event that you have planned on that day. If there is no event on that day it should return "nothing is planned for this day". Your planner should encompass the dates between 12/21/24
through 1/7/2025. You should have atleast 5 events planned.
