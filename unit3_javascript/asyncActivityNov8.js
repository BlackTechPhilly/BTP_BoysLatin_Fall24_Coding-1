// # ## Async Activity November 8th, 2024 ##
// # inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 
// # asyncActivityNov8.py OR asyncActivityNov8.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 

// # Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 

// # Good luck.

// # 1. What does "string concatenation" mean? Please write your response as 
// # a string and also provide a code example of two variables 
// # being concatenated and output the result in your terminal. 

"con-cat-ten-nation"
'String concatenation is the process of combineing 2 strings together'
'using the + (addtion) operator.'

var firstWord =' good afternoon '
var secondWord =' coding class'

console.log(firstWord + secondWord)

// # - if you are learning JavaScript you will be using the 
// # console.log() function.

// # - if you are learning Pyhon you will be using the print() function.

// # 2. Please list and describe three
// rules for creating variable names. 

'Variable names should confrom' 
'to the formatting rules; camel case, snake case, pascal' 

'1. variables cannot start with numbers or symbols. they must'
'start with a letter.'
'2. variable names are case sensative.'
'3. variable names cannot be a JS keyword/ reserved word.'

// # 3. Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.

// # - Camel case - every word after the first word is capitalized. 
var firstNameLastName =''
// # - Snake case - every word is seperated with an underscore.
var first_Name_last_Name=''
// # - Pascal case - every word is capitalized- still no spaces
var FirstNameLastName =''

// # 4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets

// # *** Python Version***
// a = ''

// b = a *100

// print(b) # the output in the terminal should be 300. 

// # *** JavaScript Version***
 let a = 350

 let b = a * 2

 console.log(b) // the output in the terminal should be 700. 

// # 5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables
// # to get the requested result.

// # ***Python Version***
// # - which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions are **true**. use the print function to output the result in the termial, 
// then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.

// need to figure out which LOGICAL operator we need to use
// to print out TRUE 

x= 10 // 10

y= 2 // 2

z= y*2 // 4

 console.log( x > 1 &&	z== 4) 
// is 10 greater than 1= true
// is 4 equal to 4= true

// # ***JavaScript Version***
// # - which logical operator would you use to 
// reflect that the result between the code expressions 
// below are **false**. Use the console.log() function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.

// baased on the variables and their comparisons,
// which logical operator will we use to return false.

var x= 12

var y= 2

var z= 12/y

 console.log(x <= 12 ____ z < 10)
