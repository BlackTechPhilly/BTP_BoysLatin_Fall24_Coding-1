// Lesson on Conditional Statements
// Discuss the anatomy of a function 


// Activity 

// 1. Create a function that will convert a number that is passed into the 
// functions parameters and convert the number into minutes. 
// For example, a value of 2 should return 120 minutes. a value of 3 should
// return 180 minutes, etc. 

// 2. Create a function that will accept a word in the function parameter
// and return the word in reverse order.
// For example, the word 'pet' should return as 'tep', the word 'book'
// should return as 'koob', etc. 
// HINT- There is a built-in function that you can use to accomplish this. 


// 3. Create a function that uses a conditional statement to output a block
// of text that will tell users about a states landmarks. 
// Your program should return the following states and their respective 
// landmarks. For example, if a user passes in the value of south carolina,
// in the function parameter, your program should return the message:
// ' A landmark in South Carolina is Fort Sumter, where the inital shots of the'
// 'American Civil war took place.' WRITE A COMPLETE SENTENCE!

// Pennsylvania = Liberty Bell.
// New York = Statue of Liberty.
// California = Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
// One additional state and landmark of your choice.

// If you pass in a state that does not exist in your program,
// your function should return a message saying that the state 
// could not be found.
