// data types = most fundamental building block
// of JS programming language. 

// String data type- are characters bound together
// with quotation marks
"anything wrapped in quotes"
"it can be numbers, letter, and symbols"
"we can create strings with the double quotation marks."
'we can also write strings with single quotation marks.'

// Integer data type- numbers
// doesn't matter if its a whole or decimal number

// boolean data type - true or false value.
true
false 

// variables - containers for data 
// we create variables by doing the following:
// 1. we need to declare the type of variable we are using.
// 2. we need to give the variable a name.
// 3. we need to give it an equal sign.
// 4. we need to give it data/ a value.

var weather_city = 'philly' // universal variable keyword. 
let weather_temp = 70 // temporary/ expected to change.
let forcast_weekly = 'sunny' // constant/ doesnt change.
const main_city_weather ='Philly'




var example1 = 'this is a string' // anything wrapped in quotes.
var example2 = true // boolean = true and false.
var example3 = 128932 // integers = numbers.

// var is short for variable- 
// it is the universal keyword for a variable
// when you create a variable you always need to start with 'var'
// OR use 'let' or 'const' BUT these have special contextual usage.

var userAddress = '123 main street'

// var is a keyword- meaning it is a word built into the JavaScript
// language. e cannot use keywords in anyway other 
// than how JS knows it

var userPhoneNumber2= 56747647887
var phoneNumber= '' 

let='' // special usage- data is expected to change.

const='' // special usage- data is expected to NOT change.

// camel case = every word after the first is capitalized. 
var tiktokAccountName= 'ian123'

// snake case = every word is seperated by an underscore.
var tiktok_account_name= 'kimble321'

// pascal case = every word is capitalized.
