# These questions are code agnostic (meaning it does not matter which coding language you are learning, you should be able to answer them. )

## <b>Read through the prompt carefully, then answer the following quesitons</b>

Boys Latin has hired you to develop a grade checker program for students. 
Your program should be able to do the following; allow a student to enter a numerical grade, then return the appropriate letter grade. For example; if a student enters the number 80, the program should give back the letter grade "B".
Your program should then repeat by  asking the user to enter another numerical grade. Each time a user enters another numerical grade, it should perform some calculation to average out the grades and show the new letter grade, For example: if the user enters the number 70, and the 100, they're average should be an 85, which is a B.

1. In a complete sentence, what is the problem asking you to do ?

2. Where there any parts of the question that don't make sense, if so write them down in complete sentences. 

3. Please write down the keywords and phrases that will help you solve this problem ? 

4. Does the problem provide you with any input data? Does it tell you what type of data your program needs to take in ?

5. Does the problem provide you with desired output data? Does it tell you that your program needs to give somthing back to the user ? 

6. Using Pseudocode (fake code), write down Step by step how you think you can solve this problem. Remember, this does not have to be code.  

## <b>Read through the prompt carefully, then answer the following quesitons</b>
You are working on a game concept with several other engineers and you need to provide them with a simple proof of concept. 
For now, you have suggested that your game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop. When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, the computer will randomly select one of the 3 options as well. Based on the results of a match, Your program should conditionally determine who won, loss, or if it was a draw based on the values. The game should only allow the player to play 3 for 3 turns, and inform the player if the won or lost that match at the end (this RPS game is a best of 2 out of 3 format.)
