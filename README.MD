# Black Tech Philly's Coding Cohort Fall 2024

## Class Overview 
This course includes the following:
<br/>
**Coding I (Intro to coding)**
<br/>
**Coding II**
<br/>

## Class Workflow
In this course, students will engage in lectures that cover key coding concepts and gain hands-on experience by reading and writing code. Learning will be reinforced through a mix of lectures, activities, quizzes, and projects.

## Async Friday Activity Guidelines
Starting in October of 2024, Fridays will feature asynchronous coding activities for students. These tasks will reinforce concepts covered throughout the week and challenge students to apply their research and collaboration skills. 
<br/>

Async Activities for the week can be found in the "asyncActivity" folder found in this repository. 
<br/>

**Activities will be due by the end of the class period. If a student is absent, the activity will be assigned as homework and must be submitted by 9:59 PM that same Friday.**

## Coding Conventions 
**Naming Files, Folders, and Variables**
<br/>
In software development, engineers often collaborate on code that spans multiple files and involves several contributors. Much of the code they work on isn't brand newâ€”it could have been written years ago. Similarly, engineers leave behind code that others may work on long after they've moved on from the project. To ensure that everyone can navigate and understand these complex codebases, developers follow coding standards that promote clarity and consistency. 

- A file/ folder/ variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_).
- A file/ folder/ variable name cannot start with a digit
- A file/ folder/ variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ ).
- A file/ folder/ variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
- There is no limit on the length of the file/ folder/ variable name BUT it is strongly recommended to keep name short and succinct. 
- A File/ folder/ variable name cannot contain spaces.
- The variable name cannot be any keywords/ reserved words.

**Multi-Word Naming Conventions**
<br/>
If you encounter a situation where your file, folder, or variable name is more than one word, use the following conventions to name your documents and code apporpriately. 

- **Camel Case**: Writing names where the first word begins with a lowercase letter and the first letter of every other word after is capitalized. No spaces. Example: firstProject, newAssignment, camelCase

- **Pascal Case**: Writing names where the first letter of each word begins with a uppercase letter. No spaces. Example: IanAssignmentProject, PascalCase, MidtermProject  

- **Snake Case**: Writing names where all words are lowercase but separated with the underscore symbol ( _ ). No spaces. Example: snake_case, new_folder, html_quiz_one

## Publishing work to Github** 
When you have completed an assignment, or would just like to ensure the work you've done is visible on your Github repo page, do the following steps to pubhlish your work to Github.

1. navigate to the source control tab on the left side of your 
vsCode codespace editor.

2. In the text field labeled "Message", in a sentence, write a brief message describing what work you have done. Your message, should be a descriptive and clear complete sentence. 

3. Once you've written your commit message click on the green button labeled "Commit". Then click it again when it is labeled as "sync changes". 

**IF YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE DOES NOT FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES YOU WILL LOSE POINTS**
