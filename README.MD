## Coding Conventions 
**Naming files, folders, and variables**
<br/>
In software development, engineers will work on code that is written in multiple files with multiple people. 
Often times, this code will not be new and could've been written many years ago. On the flipside, engineer will leave code for others that may be working on the same document years after they've moved on. Because so many people need to work on these complex documents, there are coding standards that engineers follow to ensure everyone can understand whats going on. 

- A file/ folder/ variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_).
- A file/ folder/ variable name cannot start with a digit
- A file/ folder/ variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ ).
- A file/ folder/ variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
- There is no limit on the length of the file/ folder/ variable name BUT it is strongly recommended to keep name short and succinct. 
- A File/ folder/ variable name cannot contain spaces.
- The variable name cannot be any keywords/ reserved words.

**Multi-word Naming Conventions**
<br/>
If you encounter a situation where your file, folder, or variable name is more than one word, use the following conventions to name your documents and code apporpriately. 

- **Camel Case**: Writing names where the first word begins with a lowercase letter and the first letter of every other word after is capitalized. No spaces. Example: firstProject, newAssignment, camelCase

- **Pascal Case**: Writing names where the first letter of each word begins with a uppercase letter. No spaces. Example: IanAssignmentProject, PascalCase, MidtermProject  

- **Snake Case**: Writing names where all words are lowercase but separated with the underscore symbol ( _ ). No spaces. Example: snake_case, new_folder, html_quiz_one

## Publishing work to Github** 
When you have completed an assignment, or would just like to ensure the work you've done is visible on your Github repo page, do the following steps to pubhlish your work to Github.

1. navigate to the source control tab on the left side of your 
vsCode codespace editor.

2. In the text field labeled "Message", in a sentence, write a brief message describing what work you have done. Your message, should be a descriptive and clear complete sentence. 

3. Once you've written your commit message click on the green button labeled "Commit". Then click it again when it is labeled as "sync changes". 

**IF YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE DOES NOT FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES YOU WILL LOSE POINTS**
